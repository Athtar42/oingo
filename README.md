# oingo
Database Class Project

An website app that allows users to share useful informationbased on social, geographic, temporal, and keyword constraints. 

Of course, oingo borrows ideas from many existing applications such as Foursquare, Twitter, Facebook, etc. The main idea in oingo is that users can publish information in the form of short notes, and then link these notes to certain locations and certain times. Other users can then receive these notes based on their own location, the current time, and based on what type of messages they want to receive. The startup believes that this may become a popular application as it can be useful in many scenarios.
